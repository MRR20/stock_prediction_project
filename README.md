**Stock Price Prediction using News Sentiment and Historical Data** 

This project aims to predict future stock (of only next day, and inter day prediction) using past News data and past Stock price trends. This project uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) as prediction model, where it takes input of News Sentiment Score and Stock Closing price.

**Models** :
1. LSTM - for prediction
2. VADER lexicon - for News sentiment

And this project uses "yfinance" for Stock Prices and "The Guardian News API" for News data. This project is developed using TensorFlow framework.

**Development Scope** : This project can be further developed, and latest models can be used like BERT, FinBERT, GPT, etc., for News Sentiment and other Time series models like RNN, GRU, etc., for prediction.
